# php-sql-login
A basic boilerplate for a PHP / SQL user login and registration.  

# Goal
No third-party apps, just standard PHP session authentication which can be edited further.  
This project is kept as light as possible, so that it can be used in many places.      

# Hashing
Hashes created with PHP's BCRYPT algorithm.  

# Connections
SQL connections are connected with PDO and prepared statements.  
These queries will be moved to stored procedures after testing.  

# Requirements
Requires PHP 5 >= 5.1.2
